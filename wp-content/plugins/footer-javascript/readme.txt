This plugin automatically moves JavaScript code to page footer, speeding up page loading time.

== Description ==

The Yahoo! Exceptional Performance team recommends <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#js_bottom">placing scripts at the bottom of your page</a> because of the way browsers download components.

"The problem caused by scripts is that they block parallel downloads. The HTTP/1.1 specification suggests that browsers download no more than two components in parallel per hostname. If you serve your images from multiple hostnames, you can get more than two downloads to occur in parallel. While a script is downloading, however, the browser won't start any other downloads, even on different hostnames.

In some situations it's not easy to move scripts to the bottom. If, for example, the script uses document.write to insert part of the page's content, it can't be moved lower in the page. There might also be scoping issues. In many cases, there are ways to workaround these situations."

WordPress default behavior is to load javascript in the <head> page.

This plugin will move all javascript code to the footer if the plugins have <a href="http://www.prelovac.com/vladimir/best-practice-for-adding-javascript-code-to-wordpress-plugin">declared javascript properly</a>.
